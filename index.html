		No phone no lights no motor car not a single luxury. Like Robinson
		Crusoe it's primitive as can be. Doin' it our way. Nothin's gonna turn
		us back now. Straight ahead and on the track now. We're gonna make our
		dreams come true. Movin' on up to the east side. We finally got a
		piece of the pie. Well the first thing you know ol' Jeds a
		millionaire. Kinfolk said Jed move away from there. It's time to play
		the music. It's time to light the lights. It's time to meet the
		Muppets on the Muppet Show tonight. Now the world don't move to the
		beat of just one drum. What might be right for you may not be right
		for some. So join us here each week my friends you're sure to get a
		smile from seven stranded castaways here on Gilligans Isle! So this is
		the tale of our castaways they're here for a long long time. They'll
		have to make the best of things its an uphill climb. <span
			class="bold-blue">Fish don't fry in the kitchen and beans
			don't burn on the grill. Took a whole lotta tryin' just to get up
			that hill.</span> Didn't need no welfare states. Everybody pulled his
		weight. Gee our old Lasalle ran great. Those were the days., And if
		you threw a party - invited everyone you knew. You would see the
		biggest gift would be from me and the card attached would say thank
		you for being a friend. The Love Boat soon will be making another run.
		The Love Boat promises something for everyone? Just two good ol' boys
		Wouldn't change if they could. Fightin' the system like a true modern
		day Robin Hood.
